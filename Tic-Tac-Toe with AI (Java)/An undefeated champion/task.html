<p>Congratulations, you've almost reached the finish line! In this stage, you'll transform the AI into a formidable opponent by implementing the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level.</p>
<p>Unlike the <code class="java">medium</code> difficultly level, where the AI just looks one move ahead to see an immediate win or prevent an immediate loss, the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level uses a more advanced strategy. At <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level, AI can look two moves ahead, three moves ahead, and even further. That is, it evaluates the entire game tree by simulating all possible moves, looking multiple steps ahead. It can calculate all possible moves that might be played during the game, and choose the best move based on the assumption that its opponent will also play perfectly. So, it doesn't rely on the mistakes of its opponent and plays the game flawlessly from start to finish, regardless of the opponent's skill level!</p>
<p>This advanced decision-making is powered by the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">minimax algorithm</a></strong>. It's a recursive brute-force algorithm that maximizes the AI's advantage while minimizing the opponent's chances of winning. Minimax is not just for Tic-Tac-Toe. You can use it with any other game where two players make alternate moves, such as chess.</p>

<p>In this last stage, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the <code class="java">hard</code> difficulty level using the minimax algorithm.</li>
<li>Add the <code class="java">hard</code> parameter to enable games against this level.</li>
<li>Ensure that the AI plays optimally, making it a challenging opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the previous stage, the possible states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Draw</code> — when no side has three in a row, and the table is complete;</li>
<li><code class="java">X wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">X</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally);</li>
<li><code class="java">O wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">O</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, ensure that the program handles invalid input gracefully. For example, if the <code class="java">start</code> command is given without valid parameters, display the message <code class="java">Bad parameters!</code></p>
<p>The minimax algorithm can be conceptually tricky, especially for beginners, as it involves recursion. To help you understand it, here are some recommended resources:</p>
