<p>Now it's time to make a working game, so let's create our first opponent! In this version of the program, the user will be playing as <code class="java">X</code>, and the computer will be playing as <code class="java">O</code> at <code class="java">easy</code> level. This will be our first small step towards creating the AI!</p>
<p>Let's design it so that at this level the computer makes random moves. This should be perfect for people who have never played the game before!</p>
<p>If you want, you could make the game even simpler by including a difficulty level where the computer never wins. Feel free to create this along with the <code class="java">easy</code> level if you like, but it won't be tested.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should implement the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Display an empty table when the program starts.</li>
<li>The user plays first as <code class="java">X</code>, and the program should ask the user to enter cell coordinates.</li>
<li>Next, the computer makes its move as <code class="java">O</code>, and the players then move in turn until someone wins or the game results in a draw.</li>
<li>Print the final outcome at the very end of the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The possible states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Draw</code> — when no side has three in a row, and the table is complete;</li>
<li><code class="java">X wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">X</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally);</li>
<li><code class="java">O wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">O</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally).</li>
</ul>
<p>Like in the previous stage, if the user provides invalid coordinates, the program should repeat the request until valid numbers representing an empty cell on the table are supplied.</p>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>The example below shows how your program should work.<br/>
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
