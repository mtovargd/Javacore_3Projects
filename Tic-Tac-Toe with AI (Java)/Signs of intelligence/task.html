<p>Let's enhance our AI by adding a <code class="java">medium</code> difficulty level. This AI will be more challenging to beat than the <code class="java">easy</code> difficulty level, as it incorporates basic awareness of the game state. While its initial moves are still random, it follows a strategic set of rules to play more effectively.</p>
<p>When the AI plays at <code class="java">medium</code> level, it focuses on winning whenever possible because of its first rule, or blocking the opponent's winning moves because of its second rule. This makes the game more engaging and competitive.</p>
<p>You can see these rules below.</p>
<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>
<p>When the AI is playing at <code class="java">medium</code> difficulty level, it makes moves based on the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Winning move:</strong> If the AI has two in a row and can win with one more move, it takes that move.</li>
<li><strong>Blocking move:</strong> If the opponent has two in a row and can win with one more move, the AI blocks it.</li>
<li><strong>Fallback move:</strong> If neither of the above applies, the AI makes a random move.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should add a <code class="java">medium</code> parameter so that you can play against this level. It should also be possible for AIs at different levels (<code class="java">easy</code> and <code class="java">medium</code>) to play against each other!</p>
<p>Like the previous stage, the possible states are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">Draw</code> — when no side has three in a row, and the table is complete;</li>
<li><code class="java">X wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">X</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally);</li>
<li><code class="java">O wins</code> — when there are three <code class="java">O</code>'s in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, ensure that the program handles invalid input gracefully. For example, if the <code class="java">start</code> command is given without valid parameters, display the message <code class="java">Bad parameters!</code></p>
<h5 id="example" style="text-align: center;">Example</h5>
<p>The example below shows how your program should work.<br/>
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
